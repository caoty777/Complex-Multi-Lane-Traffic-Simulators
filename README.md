# CSE6730-Group-59-Project2
* The final submission files are the following:
1. CA_simulator.py : simulator code for the CA model
2. EB_simulator.py: simulator code for the Event-Based model
3. AS_simulator.py: simulator code for the Acativity-Scanning model
4. final_report.pdf: the final project report

* Instructions to Run the Code:  
All three code files are written in Python, which can be put in GT PACE server to run without any additional steps.  
  
* Input arguments for the simulators:  
CA_simulator.py - None  
EB_simulator.py - an integer representing the max total number of vehicles to be injected into the road (enter the value when the terminal prompts to do so)  
AS_simulator.py - None  
  
* Output of the simulators:  
All three simulators will output the average travelling time in the terminal once finished.
